# Snake Photo Editor - Python GUI application to edit images with various filters and enhancements.
Fun project created as a experiment trying to recreate some of the photo editing software features purely in Python (which is probably a terrible idea).

Application created as a part of uni project and is not meant to be used in any professional setting, although can be helpful if you need to quickly edit some images.

## Features:
- Supports .jpg, .png and .bmp formats
- Implementation of common filters used in image processing (grayscale, negative, sharpening etc.)
- Resizing and crop tools
- Batch (multiple) image processing
- Changes history (undo, redo etc.) system
- Applying new images, watermarks, borders and text on top of loaded image
- Blend modes for applied filters (with strenght controls)

## Running:
- After cloning the project install required dependencies using `pip` (opencv, cvui, pillow, tkinter, numpy) and run. Can be built into a single executable binary.

## Todo:
- Nothing, Python is not the best language for the job, therefore project is frozen.

## Stack:
- Python 3.10 + [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python) + [cvui](https://github.com/Dovyski/cvui) + [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)

## Credits:
The project was created in a team consisting of Wojciech Ostrowski, Krzysztof Mika and Przemyslaw Niewolinski.
